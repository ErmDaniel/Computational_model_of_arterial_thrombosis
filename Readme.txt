Basic file calculating laser-induced thrombosis in wild type mouse
3d_mouse_laser_injury_wild_type_normal_mesh.mph

Same calculation but with another error indicator function (in Adaptive mesh refiniment feature in Study)
This error function showed more robust behaviour in our 2D calculations, and may be useful if significant modification to model geometry (or model parameters)
will be applied.
